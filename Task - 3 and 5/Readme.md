This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying iris flowers using different algorithms.

## Overview 📝

This project aims to classify iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used for this project is the classic Iris dataset.

## Contents 📂

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand the dataset and its features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset and prepare it for modeling.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data distributions, correlations, and more.
- **Modeling**: Train and evaluate different models including SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.
- **User Interaction**: Predict the species of an iris flower based on user input.

## Algorithms and Results 📊

We experimented with multiple algorithms and evaluated their performance:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Achieved an accuracy of {accuracy}%.
- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of {accuracy}%.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of {accuracy}%.

## Feature Importance 📈

We used permutation importance to determine feature importance for the Decision Tree model. The following features had the most impact on the predictions:
