# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## Introduction 🌟
Predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning to understand who survived the tragic disaster. This project showcases the power of logistic regression in predicting outcomes from historical data. The predictive model provides valuable insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Dataset 📊
The Titanic dataset includes passenger attributes such as:
- Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Sex: Gender of the passenger
- Age: Age of the passenger
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

These attributes serve as input features for the predictive model.

## Setup and Usage 🛠️
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` and follow the prompts to input passenger attributes.
4. The model will predict survival likelihood and display the result.

## Visualization 📊
Visualizations using the Seaborn library offer insights into survival trends, illustrating how factors like gender, class, and embarkation point affected outcomes. The included visualizations help users better understand the data and its patterns.

## Accuracy Metrics 📈
Accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix evaluate the model's performance. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities and its ability to generalize to new data.

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions are welcome! Open issues for feedback or submit pull requests to enhance the project. Whether it's improving the code, adding more visualizations, or refining the documentation, your contributions are valuable.
